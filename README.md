# Rork.app Chat Code Exporter Script

## Description

This browser script allows users to export the complete file structure and code content displayed within a [Rork.app](https://rork.com/) chat interface into a downloadable ZIP archive. It recursively navigates the file tree shown in the chat, extracts text-based code, and attempts to download binary files (like images) if they are displayed using Base64 Data URLs.

## Features

*   **Recursive Directory Export:** Navigates through the folder structure presented in the Rork.app file tree.
*   **Text File Extraction:** Extracts code from text files using direct reading or clipboard fallback via the "Copy" button.
*   **Binary File Handling:** Attempts to extract binary files (currently focused on images) from `<img>` tags using Base64 `data:` URLs found in the preview area.
*   **ZIP Archive:** Packages all extracted files and folders into a single `.zip` file for easy download, preserving the directory structure.
*   **Dynamic Loading:** Loads the necessary JSZip library from a CDN.

## How to Use

1.  **Open Rork.app:** Navigate to the specific Rork.app chat/project page containing the file structure you want to export.
2.  **Open Developer Console:** Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"). Go to the "Console" tab.
3.  **Keep Tab Focused:** Ensure the Rork.app tab remains **active and in focus** during the entire script execution. The script might need to access the clipboard, which often requires the tab to be focused.
4.  **Copy the Script:** Copy the entire JavaScript code provided below.
5.  **Paste and Run:** Paste the script into the developer console and press `Enter`.
6.  **Wait:** The script will start navigating the file tree, clicking folders/files, and extracting content. This might take some time depending on the project size and network speed due to built-in delays. Observe the progress logs in the console.
7.  **Permissions (Maybe):** Your browser might ask for permission to access the clipboard. Allow it if prompted.
8.  **Download:** Once finished, your browser will prompt you to download a `.zip` file named like `project_export_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss-sssZ.zip`.

## The Script

```javascript
(async () => {
  console.log("üöÄ Starting Rork.app Code Export...");

  // 1. Load JSZip library
  await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js";
    s.onload = resolve;
    s.onerror = reject;
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  });

  const zip = new JSZip();
  const fileDisplayDelay = 1800; // Time (ms) to wait for the editor to load after clicking

  // 2. Get all file buttons in the visible file tree
  const buttons = [...document.querySelectorAll("button[data-radix-collection-item]")];
  if (!buttons.length) {
    alert("‚ùå No file buttons found. Is the file tree visible?");
    return;
  }
  console.log(`üìÅ Found ${buttons.length} file entries.`);

  // 3. Click through each file, extract code
  for (const button of buttons) {
    const labelEl = button.querySelector("p, span");
    const name = labelEl?.innerText?.trim() ?? "(unnamed)";
    const isFile = button.querySelector("svg.lucide-file");
    if (!isFile || !name.includes(".")) continue;

    console.log(`üìÑ Opening file: ${name}`);
    button.click();
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, fileDisplayDelay));

    const codeBlock = document.querySelector('div.cm-content[role="textbox"]');
    const code = codeBlock?.innerText ?? "";

    if (code.trim()) {
      zip.file(name, code);
      console.log(`‚úÖ Added: ${name} (${code.length} characters)`);
    } else {
      console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è No code found in: ${name}`);
      zip.file(`${name}_empty.txt`, "// No content found.");
    }
  }

  if (Object.keys(zip.files).length === 0) {
    alert("‚ùå No files extracted. Please check if files are loaded.");
    return;
  }

  // 4. Create and trigger ZIP download
  const blob = await zip.generateAsync({ type: "blob" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement("a");
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `rork_export_${new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, "-")}.zip`;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
  document.body.removeChild(a);
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);

  alert("‚úÖ Export complete ‚Äì ZIP download started!");
})();
```

## Dependencies

*   **JSZip:** This script dynamically loads the JSZip library from [cdnjs.cloudflare.com](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/) to create the ZIP archive in the browser. An internet connection is required for this.

## Configuration (Optional Adjustments)

You can modify these constants at the beginning of the script if needed:

*   `fileDisplayDelay`: Increase if code or previews take longer to load after clicking a file.
*   `folderExpandDelay`: Increase if folder expansion animation is slow.
*   `binaryFileExtensions`: Add or remove file extensions to customize which files are treated as binary (attempting Base64 extraction) vs. text (attempting code extraction).

## Troubleshooting / Known Issues

*   **Site Updates:** This script relies on specific HTML structure and CSS classes found on Rork.app **at the time of writing**. If Rork.app updates its interface, the CSS selectors (`codeBlockSelector`, `copyButtonSelector`, `binaryPreviewImageSelector`, root container selector, selectors within `processDirectory`) **will likely break**, and the script will need to be updated.
*   **CSS Selectors:** The accuracy of the CSS selectors is crucial. If the script fails to find elements, double-check these selectors against the current Rork.app structure using your browser's developer tools. The copy button selector uses `:has()`, which might not be supported in very old browsers.
*   **Delays:** If the script runs too fast for your connection or computer, increase the `fileDisplayDelay` and `folderExpandDelay` values.
*   **Clipboard Access:** The script attempts a clipboard fallback for text files. This requires the browser tab to have focus and may require you to grant permission. If clipboard access fails repeatedly, ensure the tab is active.
*   **Binary File Export:** Exporting binary files **only works if Rork.app displays a preview using an `<img>` tag with a Base64 encoded `data:` URL as the `src`**. Other binary file types or display methods will likely result in a placeholder file (`_preview_not_found.txt` or similar) being added to the ZIP.
*   **CDN Reliability:** The script depends on CDNJS being available to load JSZip. If the CDN is down or blocked, the script will fail.
*   **Deeply Nested Folders:** Very deep folder structures might take a long time or potentially hit browser recursion limits (though unlikely).
*   **Dynamic Content Loading:** If Rork.app loads file content or previews in a way that isn't captured by the simple delay (e.g., complex asynchronous operations without clear visual cues), extraction might fail for some files.
